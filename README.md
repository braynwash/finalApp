# Final

This is the final assignment for N322.

# Purpose

This project aims to culminate everything we've learned during N322 from Firebase Authentication to CRUD features.

# Tasks

In this project, I have...

- created a simple, responsive mobile page with basic page elements,
- included navigation tabs with icons that take users to seperate pages,
- included sign in, sign up, email verification and sign out functionality using Firebase,
- limited the visible tabs/page content to signed in users only,
- added create and delete features,
- uploaded the project to Github, and
- submited the project with the link to the Github repo.

# Set up

After downloading the assignment, you can run the project by...

- type and run `npm install` in the terminal to download remaining dev dependencies,
- run the `expo` command from NPM Scripts (Visual Studio Code) to generate a live server that purges the previous tunnel and create a new one,
- open any mobile device with Expo installed and launch the application, and
- scan the QR code/open the app within Expo Go.
